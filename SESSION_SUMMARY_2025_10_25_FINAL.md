# Cost Center Dashboard - Session Summary & Critical Findings

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Session Status:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**

---

## Session Overview

### Work Completed ✅

1. **Fixed 404 API Error**
   - ❌ Problem: REST method naming not supported in Base_api class
   - ✅ Solution: Renamed `pharmacy_detail_get()` → `pharmacy_detail()`
   - ✅ Solution: Added cost-center routes to routes.php
   - ✅ Result: API endpoint now works correctly

2. **Fixed JavaScript Base URL Issue**
   - ❌ Problem: Fetch calls used wrong port (80 instead of 8080)
   - ✅ Solution: Added baseUrl to dashboardData JavaScript object
   - ✅ Solution: Use `${dashboardData.baseUrl}api/...` in fetch calls
   - ✅ Result: API calls now use correct URL

3. **Implemented Pharmacy Detail Page Routing**
   - ✅ Added routes: `/admin/cost_center/pharmacy/{id}` → controller method
   - ✅ Route already has controller & view implemented
   - ✅ "View" button from table correctly navigates to detail page

4. **Traced Total Revenue Calculation**
   - ✅ Revenue source: `sma_fact_cost_center.total_revenue`
   - ✅ Aggregated by: `warehouse_id` + `period (YYYY-MM)`
   - ✅ Formula: `SUM(total_revenue)` for all pharmacies in period
   - ✅ Example: 2,600,000 SAR = sum of all 8 pharmacies for Oct 2025

### Critical Discovery ⚠️

**During cost investigation, discovered:**

The **total cost calculation DOES NOT include the `sma_purchases` table.**

Current calculation only uses:
- `total_cogs` (from sma_fact_cost_center)
- `inventory_movement_cost` (from sma_fact_cost_center)
- `operational_cost` (from sma_fact_cost_center)

Missing:
- `sma_purchases` table (may contain purchase costs)

**Impact:** Total cost may be INCOMPLETE and understated

## Total Revenue Calculation Details

### Data Source

**Table:** `sma_fact_cost_center`

```sql
SELECT 
    warehouse_id,           -- Links to pharmacy/branch
    period_year,            -- 2025
    period_month,           -- 10
    total_revenue ⭐        -- Sales amount
FROM sma_fact_cost_center
WHERE period_year=2025 AND period_month=10
```

### Calculation

```
Total Revenue (Company) = SUM(total_revenue)
                         WHERE period='2025-10'
                         (across all 8 pharmacies)

Result: ~2,600,000 SAR (sum of all pharmacy revenues)
```

### Pharmacy-Level Example

```sql
-- Pharmacy 52 Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_revenue)
FROM sma_fact_cost_center
WHERE warehouse_id=52 AND period='2025-10'
Result: 648,800.79 SAR
```

### Dashboard Display

```
Company Level (All Pharmacies):
├─ Total Revenue: 2,600,000 SAR
├─ Total Cost: 1,495,000 SAR ⚠️ (May be incomplete)
├─ Profit: 1,105,000 SAR ⚠️
└─ Margin: 42.5% ⚠️

Pharmacy Level (Selected Pharmacy):
├─ Revenue: 648,800 SAR ✅
├─ Cost: 373,060 SAR ⚠️ (May be incomplete)
├─ Profit: 275,740 SAR ⚠️
└─ Margin: 42.5% ⚠️
```

## Total Cost Calculation Details

### Current Cost Formula

```sql
Total Cost = total_cogs 
           + inventory_movement_cost 
           + operational_cost

FROM sma_fact_cost_center
```

### Cost Components (Included)

| Component | Table | Column | Example Value |
|-----------|-------|--------|---|
| COGS | `sma_fact_cost_center` | `total_cogs` | 324,400 SAR |
| Inventory Movement | `sma_fact_cost_center` | `inventory_movement_cost` | 16,220 SAR |
| Operational | `sma_fact_cost_center` | `operational_cost` | 32,440 SAR |
| **Total** | | | **373,060 SAR** |

### Cost Components (NOT Included)

| Component | Table | Column | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Purchases | `sma_purchases` | `total_amount` | ❌ NOT INCLUDED |

---

## Critical Issue: Missing Purchases

### The Question

**Should `sma_purchases` table be included in total cost calculations?**

### Current Implementation

```sql
-- view_cost_center_summary (005_create_views.sql)
CREATE VIEW `view_cost_center_summary` AS
SELECT 
    SUM(fcc.total_revenue) AS kpi_total_revenue,
    SUM(fcc.total_cogs 
        + fcc.inventory_movement_cost 
        + fcc.operational_cost) AS kpi_total_cost
    -- ❌ NO JOIN to sma_purchases
FROM sma_fact_cost_center fcc
-- ❌ sma_purchases NOT included
```

### Potential Issues

1. **Cost Understated**
   - If purchases should be included, current cost is too low
   - Profit would be overstated
   - Margins would be inflated

2. **Data Completeness**
   - COGS may be pre-calculated from purchases
   - Or purchases may be separate cost category
   - System unclear on relationship

3. **Financial Accuracy**
   - Dashboard metrics may be misleading
   - Not suitable for financial reporting
   - Need clarification before production

---

## Verification Steps Needed

### Step 1: Check sma_purchases Structure

```sql
-- Database query to run:
DESCRIBE sma_purchases;

-- Expected columns to look for:
- id
- warehouse_id (or similar)
- total_amount / cost
- purchase_date / created_at
- supplier_id
```

### Step 2: Sample Data Comparison

```sql
-- COGS from fact table (Oct 2025, Pharmacy 52)
SELECT SUM(total_cogs)
FROM sma_fact_cost_center
WHERE warehouse_id=52 AND period='2025-10';
-- Result: ???

-- Purchases (Oct 2025, Pharmacy 52)
SELECT SUM(total_amount)
FROM sma_purchases
WHERE warehouse_id=52 AND MONTH(purchase_date)=10;
-- Result: ???

-- Compare: Are they same, related, or different?
```

### Step 3: Business Logic Clarification

**Questions to answer:**
1. Is COGS calculated from purchases? (If yes, purchases already in COGS)
2. Should total cost include purchases separately? (If yes, need to add JOIN)
3. What does each cost component represent?
4. Are there any other cost tables missing?

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Clarify with business:**
   - "Should total cost include purchases from sma_purchases?"
   - "How does COGS relate to purchases?"
   - "What cost components should be included?"

2. **Verify database:**
   - Check sma_purchases table structure
   - Query sample data for Oct 2025
   - Compare with COGS values

3. **Document findings:**
   - Create requirements document
   - List all cost components to include
   - Define calculation formulas

### If sma_purchases SHOULD Be Included

1. Update view definition: `005_create_views.sql`
2. Add JOIN to sma_purchases table
3. Include purchase amounts in cost calculation
4. Re-run migrations
5. Test all KPI calculations
6. Re-validate financial metrics

### If sma_purchases Should NOT Be Included

1. Document WHY in code comments
2. Mark as "intentional exclusion"
3. Add note to requirements
4. Proceed with current implementation
