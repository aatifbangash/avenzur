## 📞 FAQ

### Q: Why do I need to provide clarifications?

**A**: The dashboard uses real database data, but calculations (margin, health) need business rule confirmation from you.

### Q: Can't you just use default values?

**A**: Yes, but your business rules might be different. Better to clarify now than change later.

### Q: How long until dashboard is ready?

**A**: ~2.5 hours from when you provide clarifications.

### Q: Will the dashboard show real data?

**A**: Yes, 100% real data from your database. No hardcoded values.

### Q: Can I drill down into branches?

**A**: Yes, click any pharmacy to see its branches, then click branch to see detail.

### Q: Mobile friendly?

**A**: Yes, fully responsive design for all screen sizes.

### Q: Can I export data?

**A**: Yes, export table as CSV is already implemented.
