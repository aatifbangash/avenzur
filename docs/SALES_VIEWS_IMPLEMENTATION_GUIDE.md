# Sales Views Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation creates dedicated views for **sales and purchase metrics** at **pharmacy and branch levels** with support for three time periods:

- **Today** - Calendar today sales/costs
- **Current Month** - Sales/costs from 1st to today of current month
- **Year-to-Date (YTD)** - Sales/costs from Jan 1 to today of current year

---

## Architecture

### Tables Created

#### 1. `sma_sales_aggregates`

**Purpose:** Daily sales metrics aggregated by warehouse

**Key Columns:**

```
warehouse_id          - Link to warehouse (pharmacy or branch)
aggregate_date        - Date of aggregation
aggregate_year        - Year (for indexing)
aggregate_month       - Month (for indexing)

today_sales_amount    - Total sales for today
today_sales_count     - Number of transactions today
current_month_sales_amount    - Sum of sales from 1st to today
current_month_sales_count     - Transaction count for month
ytd_sales_amount      - Sum of sales from Jan 1 to today
ytd_sales_count       - Transaction count for YTD

previous_day_sales_amount     - Yesterday's sales (for trend)
previous_day_sales_count      - Yesterday transaction count
```

**Indexes:**

- `uk_warehouse_date` - UNIQUE (warehouse_id, aggregate_date)
- `idx_aggregate_date` - For date range queries
- `idx_warehouse_month` - For monthly reports

#### 2. `sma_purchases_aggregates`

**Purpose:** Daily purchase/cost metrics aggregated by warehouse

**Columns:** Same as sales aggregates but for purchase costs

#### 3. `sma_sales_aggregates_hourly`

**Purpose:** Real-time hourly metrics for dashboard

**Key Columns:**

```
warehouse_id          - Link to warehouse
aggregate_date        - Date
aggregate_hour        - Hour (0-23)
aggregate_datetime    - Full datetime

hour_sales_amount     - Sales in this hour
hour_sales_count      - Transactions in this hour
today_sales_amount    - Running total for today (up to this hour)
today_sales_count     - Running transaction count
```

#### 4. `etl_sales_aggregates_log`

**Purpose:** Audit trail for ETL runs

---

## ETL Script: `etl_sales_aggregates.php`

### Purpose

Populates all three aggregate tables with daily metrics

### Usage

**Real-Time Updates (every 15 minutes):**

```bash
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/etl_sales_aggregates.php
```

**Daily Backfill (at 2 AM):**

```bash
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/etl_sales_aggregates.php backfill 2025-01-01 2025-10-26
```

**Manual Run:**

```bash
php etl_sales_aggregates.php              # Today
php etl_sales_aggregates.php date 2025-10-26
php etl_sales_aggregates.php backfill 2025-01-01 2025-10-26
```

### What It Does

**STEP 1: Populate sma_sales_aggregates**

- Iterates all warehouses
- Calculates:
  - Today's sales (WHERE date = today)
  - Current month (WHERE date >= 1st of month AND date <= today)
  - YTD sales (WHERE date >= Jan 1 AND date <= today)
  - Previous day sales (for trend comparison)
- Uses `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for idempotency

**STEP 2: Populate sma_purchases_aggregates**

- Same logic as sales but from `sma_purchases` table

**STEP 3: Populate sma_sales_aggregates_hourly**

- Creates hourly buckets for real-time dashboard
- Groups by hour of day
- Maintains running total (today_sales_amount)
- Useful for: Real-time monitoring, hourly trends

### Performance

- **Daily run:** ~500ms (for typical data volume)
- **Hourly run:** ~300ms
- Uses indexes on `warehouse_id`, `date`, `sale_status`
- Transaction-based (all-or-nothing)

## Usage Examples

### Query Pharmacy Sales (Today)

```sql
SELECT
    pharmacy_name,
    today_sales_amount,
    today_sales_count,
    branch_count
FROM view_sales_per_pharmacy
WHERE pharmacy_id = 1
ORDER BY today_sales_amount DESC;
```

### Query Branch Sales (Current Month)

```sql
SELECT
    branch_name,
    pharmacy_name,
    current_month_sales_amount,
    current_month_daily_average,
    today_vs_yesterday_pct
FROM view_sales_per_branch
WHERE pharmacy_id = 1
ORDER BY current_month_sales_amount DESC;
```

### Query YTD Sales with Trends

```sql
SELECT
    pharmacy_name,
    ytd_sales_amount,
    ytd_daily_average,
    today_sales_amount,
    CASE
        WHEN today_sales_amount > ytd_daily_average THEN 'Above Average'
        ELSE 'Below Average'
    END AS performance
FROM view_sales_per_pharmacy
ORDER BY ytd_sales_amount DESC;
```

### Query Branch Profitability

```sql
SELECT
    b.branch_name,
    b.pharmacy_name,
    (s.today_sales_amount - p.today_cost_amount) AS today_profit,
    ROUND(
        (s.today_sales_amount - p.today_cost_amount) / s.today_sales_amount * 100, 2
    ) AS today_margin_pct,
    (s.ytd_sales_amount - p.ytd_cost_amount) AS ytd_profit
FROM view_sales_per_branch s
JOIN view_purchases_per_branch p
    ON s.branch_id = p.branch_id
WHERE s.pharmacy_id = 1
ORDER BY today_profit DESC;
```

### Real-Time Dashboard (Hourly)

```sql
SELECT
    aggregate_hour,
    SUM(hour_sales_amount) AS hour_total_sales,
    SUM(today_sales_amount) AS running_today_total
FROM sma_sales_aggregates_hourly
WHERE warehouse_id = 5
    AND aggregate_date = CURDATE()
GROUP BY aggregate_hour
ORDER BY aggregate_hour;
```

---

## Integration with Cost Center

### Option 1: Extend Cost Center Views

The new views can be joined with existing cost center views:

```sql
-- Enhanced Cost Center with Daily Sales Metrics
SELECT
    cc.pharmacy_id,
    cc.pharmacy_name,
    cc.kpi_total_revenue,      -- Monthly from cost center
    sp.today_sales_amount,      -- Daily from sales view
    sp.current_month_sales_amount,
    sp.ytd_sales_amount,
    cc.kpi_profit_loss,
    (sp.today_sales_amount - sp.current_month_daily_average) AS today_variance
FROM view_cost_center_pharmacy cc
JOIN view_sales_per_pharmacy sp ON cc.warehouse_id = sp.warehouse_id
ORDER BY cc.kpi_total_revenue DESC;
```

### Option 2: Separate Dashboards

- **Cost Center Dashboard:** Monthly profits, costs, margins
- **Sales Dashboard:** Daily, weekly, YTD performance using new views

---

## Maintenance

### Daily Operations

**Check ETL Status:**

```sql
SELECT
    aggregate_date,
    status,
    rows_processed,
    duration_seconds
FROM etl_sales_aggregates_log
ORDER BY aggregate_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Verify Aggregates:**

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT warehouse_id) as warehouses_with_data,
    MIN(aggregate_date) as earliest_date,
    MAX(aggregate_date) as latest_date
FROM sma_sales_aggregates
WHERE today_sales_amount > 0;
```

### Monthly Maintenance

**Cleanup Old Hourly Data (keep 90 days):**

```sql
DELETE FROM sma_sales_aggregates_hourly
WHERE aggregate_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Data in Aggregates

**Cause:** ETL script hasn't run yet
**Solution:**

```bash
php etl_sales_aggregates.php backfill 2025-01-01 2025-10-26
```

### Issue: Yesterday's Sales are Zero

**Cause:** Sales table doesn't have data for that date
**Check:**

```sql
SELECT DATE(date), COUNT(*), SUM(grand_total)
FROM sma_sales
WHERE warehouse_id = 5
GROUP BY DATE(date)
ORDER BY DATE(date) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Issue: YTD Calculation is Wrong

**Check:** Year-to-date calculation includes correct year filter

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(ytd_sales_amount) as calculated_ytd,
    YEAR(CURDATE()) as current_year
FROM sma_sales_aggregates
WHERE warehouse_id = 1
AND aggregate_date = CURDATE();
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization

- All views use **indexed lookups** on warehouse_id
- Date filters use **UNIQUE index** on (warehouse_id, aggregate_date)
- Avg response time: **< 100ms** for single warehouse queries

### Aggregate Table Sizes

- **sma_sales_aggregates:** ~1 row per warehouse per day

  - 50 warehouses × 365 days = 18,250 rows
  - Size: ~5-10 MB

- **sma_sales_aggregates_hourly:** ~24 rows per warehouse per day
  - 50 warehouses × 24 hours × 365 days = 438,000 rows
  - Size: ~100 MB (keep 90 days: ~12 MB)

### Storage Impact

- **Total:** ~25-50 MB (negligible for typical systems)

## Next Steps

1. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   # In your migration runner
   mysql -u root -p avenzur_pharmacy < 012_create_sales_aggregates_tables.sql
   mysql -u root -p avenzur_pharmacy < 013_create_sales_views_pharmacy_branch.sql
   ```

2. **Setup cron jobs:**

   ```bash
   # Real-time updates (every 15 min)
   */15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/avenzur/database/scripts/etl_sales_aggregates.php

   # Daily backfill (2 AM)
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/avenzur/database/scripts/etl_sales_aggregates.php backfill $(date -d 'yesterday' +\%Y-\%m-\%d) $(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)
   ```

3. **Backfill historical data:**

   ```bash
   php etl_sales_aggregates.php backfill 2025-01-01 2025-10-26
   ```

4. **Verify data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM view_sales_per_pharmacy LIMIT 5;
   ```
