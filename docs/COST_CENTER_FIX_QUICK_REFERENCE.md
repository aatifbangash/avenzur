# Cost Center Fix - Developer Quick Reference

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**TL;DR:** Fixed dimension tables to use `warehouse_id` instead of confusing `pharmacy_id` surrogate keys

---

## THE ISSUE (In 30 Seconds)

```
❌ BEFORE: Dimension tables had pharmacy_id (auto-increment) as primary key
         But queries needed pharmacy (which is actually warehouse_id from parent)
         This created a mismatch between table structure and business logic

✅ AFTER:  Dimension tables use warehouse_id (natural key) as primary key
          Eliminates confusion, maintains data integrity
```

## WHAT CHANGED - BY COMPONENT

### Dimension Tables

| Table              | Column       | Before                    | After                             |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `sma_dim_pharmacy` | Primary Key  | `pharmacy_id`             | `warehouse_id`                    |
| `sma_dim_branch`   | Primary Key  | `branch_id`               | `warehouse_id`                    |
| `sma_dim_branch`   | FK to Parent | `pharmacy_id` → surrogate | `pharmacy_warehouse_id` → natural |

### Views

| View                        | Field      | Before        | After                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `view_cost_center_pharmacy` | Key Return | `pharmacy_id` | `warehouse_id`          |
| `view_cost_center_branch`   | Key Return | `pharmacy_id` | `pharmacy_warehouse_id` |

### Model Functions

| Function                       | Key Field    | Before            | After                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `get_pharmacy_with_branches()` | WHERE clause | `pharmacy_id = ?` | `pharmacy_warehouse_id = ?` |
| `get_timeseries_data()`        | WHERE clause | `pharmacy_id = ?` | `warehouse_id = ?`          |
| `get_pharmacy_info()`          | WHERE clause | `pharmacy_id = ?` | `warehouse_id = ?`          |

---

## HOW TO VERIFY

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Run validation
mysql -u user -p db < database/scripts/validate_dimension_fix.sql

# 2. Check for "orphaned" errors - should be NONE

# 3. Open Cost Center dashboard
# 4. Click on a pharmacy - should drill-down to show branches
```

### Full Validation

```bash
# Run all validation checks
mysql -u user -p db < database/scripts/validate_dimension_fix.sql | grep -i "ERROR\|invalid\|orphaned"

# Should return NO matches if all is good
```

---

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1️⃣ Backup (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sma_dim_pharmacy_backup LIKE sma_dim_pharmacy;
INSERT INTO sma_dim_pharmacy_backup SELECT * FROM sma_dim_pharmacy;

CREATE TABLE sma_dim_branch_backup LIKE sma_dim_branch;
INSERT INTO sma_dim_branch_backup SELECT * FROM sma_dim_branch;
```

### 2️⃣ Apply Migrations

```bash
mysql -u user -p db < app/migrations/cost-center/010_fix_dimension_tables.sql
mysql -u user -p db < app/migrations/cost-center/011_update_views_for_warehouse_id.sql
```

### 3️⃣ Validate

```bash
mysql -u user -p db < database/scripts/validate_dimension_fix.sql
# Check output for any issues
```

### 4️⃣ Update Code (Already Included)

- Model changes already in files provided
- ETL script already updated

### 5️⃣ Test

- Load dashboard: `/admin/cost_center/dashboard`
- Drill down: Click any pharmacy
- Check branches display correctly

---

## QUICK ROLLBACK (If Needed)

```sql
DROP TABLE sma_dim_pharmacy;
RENAME TABLE sma_dim_pharmacy_backup TO sma_dim_pharmacy;

DROP TABLE sma_dim_branch;
RENAME TABLE sma_dim_branch_backup TO sma_dim_branch;
```

---

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Natural Key vs Surrogate Key

```sql
-- NATURAL KEY (GOOD ✓)
WHERE warehouse_id = 11
-- warehouse_id exists in source system (sma_warehouses)
-- Direct traceability
-- No confusion about what the ID means

-- SURROGATE KEY (CONFUSING ❌)
WHERE pharmacy_id = 1
-- pharmacy_id is generated by auto-increment
-- Multiple layers of indirection
-- Easy to confuse with other IDs
```

### The Hierarchy

```
sma_warehouses
├─ id = 11 (parent, warehouse_type='warehouse')     → Pharmacy
├─ id = 12 (child, parent_id=11, type='branch')     → Branch of Pharmacy 11
└─ id = 13 (child, parent_id=11, type='branch')     → Branch of Pharmacy 11

After Fix:
sma_dim_pharmacy
└─ warehouse_id = 11 ← Direct reference!

sma_dim_branch
├─ warehouse_id = 12, pharmacy_warehouse_id = 11 ← Natural references!
└─ warehouse_id = 13, pharmacy_warehouse_id = 11
```

---

## COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: "Pharmacy not found" error

```
Cause: Code trying to find pharmacy_id (surrogate)
       but database has warehouse_id (natural)

Solution: Run validation script to check dimensions are correct
          All queries updated to use warehouse_id
```

### Issue: Drill-down doesn't show branches

```
Cause: Old code was using wrong key to join tables

Solution: Model updated to use pharmacy_warehouse_id
          This is the correct reference to parent
```

### Issue: Views return no data

```
Cause: Views were recreated with new key structure

Solution: Run migrations to recreate views
          Already included in 011_update_views_for_warehouse_id.sql
```

## QUESTIONS?

**Q: Does this affect the budget module?**  
A: No, this is isolated to Cost Center

**Q: Will this break existing reports?**  
A: No, all reports use views which have been updated

**Q: Do we need to reload historical data?**  
A: No, fact table structure unchanged, data stays the same

**Q: Is there a performance impact?**  
A: No, natural keys actually improve performance (fewer joins)

**Q: Can we rollback?**  
A: Yes, but recommend keeping fix. Backup exists if needed.
