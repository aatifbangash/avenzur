# COST CENTER FIX - COMPLETE DELIVERY PACKAGE

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Deployment  
**Scope:** Fixed pharmacy_id vs warehouse_id confusion  
**Files:** 8 Total (3 Existing + 5 New/Modified)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Cost Center module had a critical data model issue where dimension tables were using surrogate keys (`pharmacy_id` auto-increment) instead of natural keys (`warehouse_id` from source). This caused confusion throughout the system and broke the relationship between dimensions and facts.

**Fix:** Restructured all dimension tables, views, and queries to use `warehouse_id` (natural key) consistently.

**Impact:**

- ✅ Eliminates semantic confusion
- ✅ Maintains data integrity
- ✅ Improves performance
- ✅ Enables correct drill-down navigation
- ✅ No breaking changes to APIs

## DELIVERABLES

### 🔧 Database Migrations (NEW)

#### 1. `app/migrations/cost-center/010_fix_dimension_tables.sql`

- **Purpose:** Restructure dimension tables to use natural keys
- **Size:** ~240 lines
- **Changes:**
  - `sma_dim_pharmacy`: PRIMARY KEY warehouse_id (was pharmacy_id)
  - `sma_dim_branch`: PRIMARY KEY warehouse_id (was branch_id)
  - Foreign key: pharmacy_warehouse_id (was pharmacy_id)
- **Safe:** Backs up old tables before dropping
- **Idempotent:** Safe to run multiple times

#### 2. `app/migrations/cost-center/011_update_views_for_warehouse_id.sql`

- **Purpose:** Update views to return natural keys
- **Size:** ~180 lines
- **Changes:**
  - `view_cost_center_pharmacy`: Returns warehouse_id
  - `view_cost_center_branch`: Returns warehouse_id + pharmacy_warehouse_id
  - `view_cost_center_summary`: Aggregates correctly
- **Safe:** Drops and recreates views
- **Idempotent:** Safe to run multiple times

---

### 🔍 Testing & Validation (NEW)

#### 3. `database/scripts/validate_dimension_fix.sql`

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive validation of the fix
- **Size:** ~280 lines
- **Validates:**
  - ✓ Dimension table structure (PK is warehouse_id)
  - ✓ Record counts and active status
  - ✓ Branch-pharmacy relationships (no orphans)
  - ✓ View data structure
  - ✓ Fact table consistency
  - ✓ Full warehouse hierarchy
  - ✓ Performance indexes
  - ✓ Drill-down query paths
- **Usage:** `mysql -u user -p db < validate_dimension_fix.sql`
- **Output:** Detailed validation report

---

### 💻 Code Changes (MODIFIED)

#### 4. `app/models/admin/Cost_center_model.php`

- **Lines Changed:** ~25 lines
- **Functions Updated:**
  - `get_pharmacy_with_branches()`: Now uses pharmacy_warehouse_id for branch lookup
  - `get_timeseries_data()`: Now uses warehouse_id for filtering
  - `get_pharmacy_info()`: Now queries by warehouse_id
- **Backward Compatible:** All parameter names unchanged, only WHERE clauses fixed
- **Safe:** No breaking changes to public interface

#### 5. `database/scripts/etl_cost_center.php`

- **Lines Changed:** ~8 lines (comments only)
- **Changes:**
  - Added clarification that pharmacy_id in fact table = warehouse_id values
  - No logic changes needed
  - ETL already correctly loads parent_id (which is warehouse_id)
- **Safe:** 100% backward compatible

## BEFORE vs AFTER

### Schema Changes

#### Before (Broken)

```sql
-- sma_dim_pharmacy
PRIMARY KEY (pharmacy_id)  -- Auto-increment, not in source system
UNIQUE (warehouse_id)      -- The natural key, underutilized

-- sma_dim_branch
PRIMARY KEY (branch_id)    -- Auto-increment
FOREIGN KEY (pharmacy_id)  -- References surrogate key
pharmacy_warehouse_id      -- Redundant field
```

#### After (Fixed)

```sql
-- sma_dim_pharmacy
PRIMARY KEY (warehouse_id) -- Natural key, from sma_warehouses.id
FOREIGN KEY (...) -> sma_warehouses(id)

-- sma_dim_branch
PRIMARY KEY (warehouse_id) -- Natural key, from sma_warehouses.id
FOREIGN KEY (pharmacy_warehouse_id) -> sma_dim_pharmacy(warehouse_id)
-- Clean hierarchy, no redundancy
```

### Query Changes

#### Before (Broken)

```php
// Extract surrogate key from view
$pharmacy_id = $pharmacy['pharmacy_id'];

// Use wrong key for drill-down
WHERE pharmacy_id = ?  // Looks for surrogate that might not match
```

#### After (Fixed)

```php
// Use warehouse_id directly
// warehouse_id is the natural key in the view

// Correct drill-down using parent reference
WHERE pharmacy_warehouse_id = ?  // Looks for parent's warehouse_id
```
