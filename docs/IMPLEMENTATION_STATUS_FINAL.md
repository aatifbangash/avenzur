## 🔧 Today's Fix: What Happened

### The Problem (Found at 4:22 PM)

User ran migration 013 and got error:

```
Error Code: 1146. Table 'retaj_aldawa.sma_dim_warehouse' doesn't exist
```

### The Root Cause

Views were joining with `sma_dim_warehouse` table that:

1. Doesn't exist in their database
2. Created in migration 011 (separate, may not run)
3. Contains redundant data anyway

### The Solution Applied

✅ Removed unnecessary `sma_dim_warehouse` joins from 2 views:

- `view_sales_per_pharmacy`
- `view_purchases_per_pharmacy`

✅ Result: Views now work independently using only existing tables

## 🎯 What Views Provide

### `view_sales_per_pharmacy`

```sql
SELECT
    pharmacy_name,           -- Pharmacy identifier
    warehouse_id,            -- Unique warehouse ID
    today_sales_amount,      -- Today's sales (calendar today)
    current_month_sales_amount,  -- Sales from 1st to today
    ytd_sales_amount,        -- Sales from Jan 1 to today
    today_vs_yesterday_pct,  -- Trend (% change from yesterday)
    current_month_daily_average,  -- Avg per day (month)
    ytd_daily_average,       -- Avg per day (year)
    branch_count             -- Number of branches under pharmacy
FROM view_sales_per_pharmacy;
```

### `view_sales_per_branch`

```sql
SELECT
    branch_name,             -- Branch identifier
    pharmacy_name,           -- Parent pharmacy
    today_sales_amount,      -- Today's sales
    current_month_sales_amount,  -- Month-to-date
    ytd_sales_amount,        -- Year-to-date
    today_vs_yesterday_pct,  -- Trend %
