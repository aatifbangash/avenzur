# Cost Center Database Views - Complete Implementation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All three required database views have been successfully created in the `retaj_aldawa` database.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem

The Cost Centre dashboard was generating a database error:

```
Table 'retaj_aldawa.view_cost_center_summary' doesn't exist
```

The model was trying to query three views that didn't exist:

- `view_cost_center_pharmacy`
- `view_cost_center_branch`
- `view_cost_center_summary`

### Solution

Created migration file `005_create_views.sql` that defines all three views with proper aggregation logic.

---

## Views Created

### 1. view_cost_center_pharmacy

**Purpose:** Aggregate pharmacy-level KPIs by period (monthly)

**Query Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_pharmacy WHERE period = '2025-10'
```

**Sample Output:**
| Field | Sample Value |
|-------|--------------|
| hierarchy_level | pharmacy |
| pharmacy_id | 1 |
| warehouse_id | 32 |
| pharmacy_name | Main Warehouse |
| pharmacy_code | 2000 |
| period | 2025-10 |
| kpi_total_revenue | 617,810.52 SAR |
| kpi_total_cost | 0.00 SAR |
| kpi_profit_loss | 617,810.52 SAR |
| kpi_profit_margin_pct | 100.00% |
| kpi_cost_ratio_pct | 0.00% |
| branch_count | 0 |
| last_updated | 2025-10-25 08:29:54 |

**Key Features:**

- Joins `sma_dim_pharmacy` with `sma_fact_cost_center` on `warehouse_id`
- Aggregates revenue and costs by pharmacy and month
- Calculates profit margin and cost ratios
- Counts associated branches
- Returns only active pharmacies

---

### 2. view_cost_center_branch

**Purpose:** Aggregate branch-level KPIs by period (monthly) with cost breakdown

**Query Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_branch WHERE period = '2025-10'
```

**Key Features:**

- Joins `sma_dim_branch` → `sma_dim_pharmacy` → `sma_fact_cost_center`
- Joins on `warehouse_id` (critical for data matching)
- Breaks down costs:
  - `kpi_cogs` - Cost of goods sold
  - `kpi_inventory_movement_cost` - Inter-warehouse transfer costs
  - `kpi_operational_cost` - Operational expenses
  - `kpi_total_cost` - Sum of all costs
- Calculates KPIs (profit, margin, ratio)
- Returns only active branches

---

### 3. view_cost_center_summary

**Purpose:** Company-level overview summary combining both company and pharmacy aggregates

**Query Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_summary WHERE period = '2025-10'
```

**Sample Output:**

```
+----------+----------------+---------+-------------------+
| level    | entity_name    | period  | kpi_total_revenue |
+----------+----------------+---------+-------------------+
| company  | RETAJ AL-DAWA  | 2025-10 | 617,810.52        |
| pharmacy | Main Warehouse | 2025-10 | 617,810.52        |
+----------+----------------+---------+-------------------+
```

**Key Features:**

- UNION of two result sets:
  1. **Company level**: Single row per period with company-wide totals
  2. **Pharmacy level**: One row per pharmacy per period
- `entity_count` shows:
  - For company: Number of pharmacies
  - For pharmacy: Number of branches
- Supports hierarchical drill-down
- Sorted by period (DESC) then revenue (DESC)

---

## Database Verification

### View Check

```bash
$ mysql -u admin -pR00tr00t retaj_aldawa -e "SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_Type='VIEW'" | grep view_cost

view_cost_center_branch       VIEW
view_cost_center_pharmacy     VIEW
view_cost_center_summary      VIEW
```

✅ All three views exist and are accessible.

### Data Validation

**Data in sma_fact_cost_center (as of 2025-10-25):**

- 9 rows of transaction data
- 2 periods: 2025-09 and 2025-10
- Revenue data: 617,810.52 SAR (Oct), 648,800.79 SAR (Sep)
- Costs: All currently 0.00 (no COGS/operational data yet)
- Single warehouse: warehouse_id = 32 (Main Warehouse)

**Dimension Tables:**

- `sma_dim_pharmacy`: 11 active pharmacies (including Main Warehouse)
- `sma_dim_branch`: 9 active branches
- `sma_dim_date`: Date dimension table

### View Query Tests

All views return correct results:

**Pharmacy View (2025-10):**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_pharmacy WHERE period = '2025-10'
→ Returns 1 row: Main Warehouse with 617,810.52 revenue
```

**Summary View (2025-10):**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_summary WHERE period = '2025-10'
→ Returns 2 rows: Company level + Pharmacy level
```

**Branch View (2025-10):**

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_branch WHERE period = '2025-10'
→ Currently empty (no branch-level transactions yet)
```

## File Location

**Migration File:**

```
/Users/rajivepai/Projects/Avenzur/V2/avenzur/app/migrations/cost-center/005_create_views.sql
```

**File Size:** ~3.5 KB

**Contains:**

- 3 DROP VIEW IF EXISTS statements (safe for re-runs)
- 3 CREATE VIEW statements
- Comprehensive comments and documentation
- Proper aggregation with COALESCE for NULL handling

---

## How It Works

### Join Logic Explained

**Key Discovery:** The fact table doesn't populate `pharmacy_id` and `branch_id` columns - it only has `warehouse_id`.

**Solution:** Views join on `warehouse_id` instead:

```
sma_fact_cost_center.warehouse_id → sma_dim_pharmacy.warehouse_id
sma_fact_cost_center.warehouse_id → sma_dim_branch.warehouse_id
```

This mapping works because:

- Each pharmacy has exactly 1 warehouse (1:1 relationship via `pharmacy.warehouse_id`)
- Each branch has exactly 1 warehouse (1:1 relationship via `branch.warehouse_id`)

### Aggregation Pattern

All views follow this pattern:

1. **Join dimension tables** to get names, codes, hierarchy info
2. **Join fact table** to get revenue and cost data
3. **GROUP BY** period + entity (pharmacy_id or branch_id)
4. **SUM** revenue and costs for monthly totals
5. **Calculate** KPIs (profit, margin, ratio)
6. **COUNT** subordinate entities

### Period Format

All views use YYYY-MM format for consistency:

```sql
CONCAT(period_year, '-', LPAD(period_month, 2, '0')) AS period
```

Example: `2025-10` for October 2025

---

## Model Method Support

The views support all model methods in `Cost_center_model.php`:

### Method 1: `get_summary_stats($period)`

```php
$query = "SELECT level, entity_name, period, kpi_total_revenue, kpi_total_cost,
          kpi_profit_loss, kpi_profit_margin_pct, entity_count, last_updated
          FROM view_cost_center_summary WHERE period = ?"
```

✅ **Supported by:** `view_cost_center_summary`

### Method 2: `get_pharmacies_with_kpis($period, $sort_by, $limit, $offset)`

```php
$query = "SELECT pharmacy_id, warehouse_id, pharmacy_name, ...
          FROM view_cost_center_pharmacy WHERE period = ? ORDER BY ..."
```

✅ **Supported by:** `view_cost_center_pharmacy`

### Method 3: `get_pharmacy_with_branches($pharmacy_id, $period)`

```php
-- Gets pharmacy header + branches
-- Pharmacy from: view_cost_center_pharmacy
-- Branches from: view_cost_center_branch with pharmacy_id filter
```

✅ **Supported by:** Both `view_cost_center_pharmacy` and `view_cost_center_branch`

### Method 4: `get_branch_detail($branch_id, $period)`

```php
$query = "SELECT branch_id, warehouse_id, pharmacy_id, branch_name, ...
          FROM view_cost_center_branch WHERE branch_id = ? AND period = ?"
```

✅ **Supported by:** `view_cost_center_branch`

```
1. Load /admin/cost_center/dashboard
2. Controller: Cost_center::dashboard()
3. Load views from blue theme
4. Model methods called:
   - get_summary_stats('2025-10') → view_cost_center_summary
   - get_pharmacies_with_kpis('2025-10', 'revenue') → view_cost_center_pharmacy
5. Data displayed in KPI cards and tables
```

### User clicks Pharmacy → Drill-down to Branch View

```
1. Click pharmacy row (pharmacy_id = 1)
2. Navigate to /admin/cost_center/pharmacy/1?period=2025-10
3. Model methods called:
   - get_pharmacy_with_branches(1, '2025-10')
     - Pharmacy header from view_cost_center_pharmacy

## Testing Dashboard

### To test the dashboard:

1. **Login to application:**

   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/avenzur/admin/login`
   - Credentials: (use your system admin account)

2. **Navigate to Cost Centre:**

   - Click "Cost Centre" in left sidebar
   - Or URL: `http://localhost:8080/avenzur/admin/cost_center/dashboard`

3. **Verify Dashboard Loads:**

   - 4 KPI cards display with October 2025 data
   - Total Revenue: 617,810.52 SAR
   - Pharmacy table shows Main Warehouse
   - Period selector works
   - Charts display (TrendChart shows revenue trend)

4. **Test Drill-down:**
   - Click "Main Warehouse" row
   - Should navigate to pharmacy detail
   - Shows branches (currently 0, expected)
   - Back button returns to dashboard

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Branch Data:** Currently no branch-level transactions (pharmacy_id and branch_id are NULL in fact table)

   - Expected: When branch-specific discount data is recorded
   - View will automatically show branch rows once data exists

2. **Cost Data:** All costs currently 0.00

   - Expected: When operational costs are recorded
   - KPI percentages will update automatically

3. **Single Warehouse:** Currently only warehouse_id = 32 has data
   - Expected: When data from other warehouses is loaded
   - Views will aggregate across all warehouses

---

## Next Steps

1. **Load Branch Data (Optional)**

   - If you have branch-level transactions, populate `sma_fact_cost_center` with branch_id
   - Views will automatically show branch-level KPIs

2. **Load Cost Data (Optional)**

   - If you have COGS/operational costs, populate:
     - `total_cogs`
     - `inventory_movement_cost`
     - `operational_cost`
   - KPI margins and ratios will update automatically

3. **Monitor Performance**

   - Run queries with EXPLAIN to verify index usage
   - Views use existing indexes on period_year, period_month, warehouse_id
   - No performance issues expected with current data volume

4. **Extend Views**
   - Add date-based filters (date_id from dim_date table)
   - Add region/country hierarchies
   - Add category hierarchies (product category, discount type)

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to remove the views:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `view_cost_center_pharmacy`;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `view_cost_center_branch`;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `view_cost_center_summary`;
```

Or re-run the migration file to recreate them (it includes DROP statements).
