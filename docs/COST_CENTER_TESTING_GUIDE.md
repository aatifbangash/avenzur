## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Page shows blank white screen

**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, reload page

### Problem: Page is loading but no styling/colors

**Solution:** CSS didn't load - check network tab, clear browser cache and reload

### Problem: Error messages appear in red

**Solution:** Check `app/logs/log-*.php` for detailed error messages

### Problem: Period dropdown empty

**Solution:** Database views may be missing - verify all migrations were run

### Problem: Pharmacy table empty

**Solution:** Check database - verify `view_cost_center_pharmacy` has data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_cost_center_pharmacy LIMIT 1;
```

### Problem: 500 error when clicking pharmacy

**Solution:** Check if pharmacy ID exists in database

## Logs to Check

Location: `/app/logs/log-2025-10-25.php`

Look for entries starting with:

- `[COST_CENTER]` - Debug logging from controller
- `ERROR` - Any errors that occurred

Example good log entry:

```
DEBUG - 2025-10-25 09:52:00 --> Total execution time: 0.4171
```

Example bad log entry:

```
ERROR - 2025-10-25 09:26:23 --> Severity: error --> Exception: ...
```
