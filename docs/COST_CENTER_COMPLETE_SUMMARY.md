Issues Fixed:

- ✅ Removed `$this->theme->add_js('assets/js/cost_center/pharmacy.js')` - FILE DOESN'T EXIST
- ✅ Removed `$this->theme->add_css('assets/css/cost_center/pharmacy.css')` - FILE DOESN'T EXIST
- ✅ Removed `$this->theme->add_js('assets/js/cost_center/branch.js')` - FILE DOESN'T EXIST
- ✅ Removed `$this->theme->add_css('assets/css/cost_center/branch.css')` - FILE DOESN'T EXIST

Methods Fixed:

2. `pharmacy($id)` - Lines 108-111
3. `branch($id)` - Lines 161-164

**Note:** Views already have Chart.js embedded inline, so external files not needed

---

### Phase 7: View Rendering Method ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**

**Objective:** Fix view rendering to use correct CodeIgniter syntax
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETE

Files Modified:

- `/app/controllers/admin/Cost_center.php` - 3 methods (critical fix)

Issues Fixed:

- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Changed from `$this->theme->render()` to `$this->load->view()`
  - Root cause of "Call to member function render() on string" error
  - `$this->theme` is a string path, not an object
  - `$this->load->view()` is the correct CodeIgniter method

Error That Was Happening:

```
Exception: Call to a member function render() on string
File: /app/controllers/admin/Cost_center.php
Line: 61
```

Fix Applied:

```php
// Before (BROKEN):
$this->theme->render('cost_center/cost_center_dashboard', $data);

// After (FIXED):
$this->load->view($this->theme . 'cost_center/cost_center_dashboard', $view_data);
```

Methods Fixed:

1. `dashboard()` - Line 75
2. `pharmacy($id)` - Line 128
3. `branch($id)` - Line 180

---

### Phase 8: Layout Data Variables ✅

**Objective:** Pass layout context to views for CSS/JS/settings
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETE

Files Modified:

- `/app/controllers/admin/Cost_center.php` - 3 methods

Issues Fixed:

- ✅ Added `array_merge($this->data, [custom_data])` to all 3 methods
- ✅ Ensures views have access to: assets path, Settings, layout variables
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript now loads properly

What's in `$this->data`:

- `['assets']` - Base URL for theme assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `['Settings']` - Site settings and configuration
- `['m']` - Module name
- `['v']` - View/method name
- And 10+ other layout variables needed by views

Example Fix:

```php
// Before (BROKEN - no layout data):
$data = ['summary' => $summary, 'pharmacies' => $pharmacies];
$this->load->view($this->theme . 'cost_center/cost_center_dashboard', $data);

// After (FIXED - includes layout data):
$view_data = array_merge($this->data, [
    'summary' => $summary,
    'pharmacies' => $pharmacies
]);
$this->load->view($this->theme . 'cost_center/cost_center_dashboard', $view_data);
```

Methods Fixed:

1. `dashboard()` - Lines 67-75
2. `pharmacy($id)` - Lines 118-127
3. `branch($id)` - Lines 170-179

---

### Phase 9: Debug Logging ✅

**Objective:** Add comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETE

Files Modified:

- `/app/controllers/admin/Cost_center.php` - dashboard() method

Debug Points Added:

- ✅ Method start/end logging
- ✅ Period validation logging
- ✅ Data fetch operation logging (each query with count)
- ✅ View rendering logging
- ✅ Exception logging with line numbers and stack trace

Logging Format:

```php
error_log('[COST_CENTER] Dashboard method started');
error_log('[COST_CENTER] Fetching summary stats for period: ' . $period);
error_log('[COST_CENTER] Summary stats retrieved: ' . json_encode($summary));
error_log('[COST_CENTER] About to render view');
```

Benefits:

- Easy to track execution flow in application logs
- Helps identify which step fails if errors occur
- Exception details include line numbers and file paths

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: HTTP 500 Error ❌→✅

**Solutions Applied:**

1. Changed `$this->theme->render()` to `$this->load->view()`
2. Removed asset loading calls for non-existent files
3. Added layout data variables
   **Status:** ✅ FIXED - HTTP 200 OK

### Issue 2: CSS/Styling Not Applied ❌→✅

**Error:** Page loads but has no styling, looks broken
**Root Cause:** Layout variables not passed to view, missing `$this->data`
**Solution:** Added `array_merge($this->data, ...)` to all view calls
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - CSS now loads properly

### Issue 3: Table Names Not Found ❌→✅

**Error:** "Table 'retaj*aldawa.fact_cost_center' doesn't exist"
**Root Cause:** Model methods using unprefixed table names
**Solution:** Updated all references to include `sma*` prefix
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - All table references corrected

### Issue 4: Views Not Found ❌→✅

**Error:** "Table 'retaj_aldawa.view_cost_center_summary' doesn't exist"
**Root Cause:** Database views not created
**Solution:** Created 005_create_views.sql with all 3 views
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Views created and populated

### Issue 5: Wrong Base Controller ❌→✅

**Error:** "Class 'Admin_Controller' not found"
