# 🎉 Cost Center Dashboard - Pharmacy & Branch Data Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue:** Dashboard only showed warehouse data instead of 8 actual pharmacies and 9 branches.

**Root Cause:** Queries were using `sma_dim_pharmacy` dimension table which incorrectly mapped warehouses as pharmacies.

**Solution:** Updated all queries to use `sma_warehouses` table directly with proper `warehouse_type` filtering and `parent_id` hierarchy mapping.

---

## What Changed

### 1️⃣ Model Layer (`app/models/admin/Cost_center_model.php`)

**Updated:** `get_pharmacies_with_health_scores()`

- ✅ Now returns **8 actual pharmacies** from `sma_warehouses` WHERE `warehouse_type = 'pharmacy'`
- ✅ Excludes special warehouses (32, 48, 51)
- ✅ Includes branch count for each pharmacy
- ✅ Calculates all KPIs: Revenue, Cost, Profit, Margin %
- ✅ Implements health scoring with text labels and color codes

**Added:** `get_branches_with_health_scores()`

- ✅ Returns **9 branches** with parent pharmacy links
- ✅ Links to pharmacy via `parent_id`
- ✅ Same KPI calculations and health scoring

### 2️⃣ Controller Layer (`app/controllers/admin/Cost_center.php`)

- ✅ Calls both `get_pharmacies_with_health_scores()` and `get_branches_with_health_scores()`
- ✅ Fetches margins, summary, and trends
- ✅ Passes all data to view via `$view_data`

### 3️⃣ View Layer (`themes/blue/admin/views/cost_center/cost_center_dashboard_modern.php`)

- ✅ Added branches to `dashboardData` object
- ✅ Fixed KPI card rendering with correct field names
- ✅ Added margin toggle button (Gross ↔ Net)
- ✅ Updated charts with real data
- ✅ Added health status badges to table rows
- ✅ Implemented `toggleMarginMode()` function

## Data Now Displayed

### Pharmacies (8 Total)

```
PHR-001 Avenzur Downtown Pharmacy          → 2 branches
PHR-002 Avenzur Northgate Pharmacy         → 1 branch

## Database Queries

### Pharmacy Query (Using sma_warehouses)

```sql
SELECT
    w.id, w.code, w.name,
    SUM(fcc.total_revenue) AS kpi_total_revenue,
    SUM(fcc.total_cogs + fcc.inventory_movement_cost + fcc.operational_cost) AS kpi_total_cost,
    COUNT(DISTINCT db.id) AS branch_count
FROM sma_warehouses w
LEFT JOIN sma_fact_cost_center fcc ON w.id = fcc.warehouse_id
LEFT JOIN sma_warehouses db ON db.warehouse_type = 'branch' AND db.parent_id = w.id
WHERE w.warehouse_type = 'pharmacy'
GROUP BY w.id
```

### Branch Query (Using sma_warehouses)

```sql
SELECT
    b.id, b.code, b.name,
    p.id AS pharmacy_id, p.name AS pharmacy_name,
    SUM(fcc.total_revenue) AS kpi_total_revenue
FROM sma_warehouses b
LEFT JOIN sma_warehouses p ON b.parent_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN sma_fact_cost_center fcc ON b.id = fcc.warehouse_id
WHERE b.warehouse_type = 'branch'
GROUP BY b.id
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Data Availability**: October 2025 only has Main Warehouse data. Use September 2025 or earlier for complete pharmacy data.

✅ **Database Queries**: All queries tested and working with live database.

✅ **Field Names**: Corrected from old naming (total_revenue → kpi_total_revenue).

✅ **Health Status**: Now returns text labels + hex colors (not just color names).
