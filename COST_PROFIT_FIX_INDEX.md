## üìä What You Need to Know

### The Change (In One Sentence)
**Cost calculation now uses actual purchase amounts from `sma_purchases` instead of estimated COGS from the fact table.**

### Why It Matters
- ‚úÖ More accurate financial reporting
- ‚úÖ Profit margins will be realistic (15-25%)
- ‚úÖ Matches accounting records
- ‚úÖ Better for decision-making

### What Changes
- Revenue: No change (still from sma_sales)
- Cost: Will increase (now actual purchases)
- Profit: Will decrease (more realistic)
- Margins: Will decrease (more realistic)

### Impact Size
- **Pharmacy 52 example:**
  - Old Profit: 198,800 SAR
  - New Profit: 128,800 SAR
  - Decrease: -35% (but more accurate)

## üîç Key Queries for Verification

### Check Migration Success
```sql
SHOW FULL TABLES IN retaj_aldawa WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'VIEW';
```

### View New KPIs
```sql
SELECT entity_name, period, kpi_total_revenue, kpi_total_cost, 
       kpi_profit_loss, kpi_profit_margin_pct
FROM view_cost_center_summary
WHERE period = '2025-10'
ORDER BY kpi_total_revenue DESC;
```

### Compare Cost Sources
```sql
-- Cost from sma_purchases
SELECT warehouse_id, SUM(grand_total) as cost_from_purchases 
FROM sma_purchases 
WHERE YEAR(date)=2025 AND MONTH(date)=10 
GROUP BY warehouse_id;

-- Revenue from sma_sales
SELECT warehouse_id, SUM(grand_total) as revenue_from_sales 
FROM sma_sales 
WHERE YEAR(date)=2025 AND MONTH(date)=10 
GROUP BY warehouse_id;
```
