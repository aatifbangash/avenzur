## ⏳ PENDING - AWAITING YOUR INPUT

### To Proceed with Real Data Integration, Please Clarify:

1. **Profit Margin Calculation**: Which formula?

   - Gross Margin: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
   - Net Margin: (Revenue - COGS - Inventory - Operational) / Revenue
   - Current implementation: Net Margin

2. **Revenue Definition**: How to calculate?

   - Source: `sma_sales` table
   - Include refunds? Y/N
   - Date range: 30/90 days/full history?

3. **Cost Components**: What should "Total Cost" include?

   - COGS only?
   - COGS + Inventory Movement?
   - COGS + Inventory + Operational?
   - Plus loyalty discounts?

4. **Trends**: What time periods?

   - Monthly (last 12 months) ← Recommended
   - Weekly (last 12 weeks)
   - Daily (last 30 days)

5. **Health Score**: What are the thresholds?
   - Green: Margin > **, Revenue > **
   - Yellow: Margin **-**, OR Revenue declining \_\_
   - Red: Margin < **, OR Revenue declining **

## 📊 CURRENT DASHBOARD STATE

### What Works ✅

- KPI cards display (but with placeholder data)
- Charts render (but with placeholder data)
- Table displays pharmacy list from database
- Period selector works
- Pharmacy filter works
- Drill-down navigation works

### What Needs Real Data ⏳

- Profit Margin Trend chart (needs real calculation)
- Cost Breakdown chart (needs component breakdown)
- Revenue comparison (can show real data)
- Health badges (needs threshold logic)
- Trial Balance section (not yet implemented)
