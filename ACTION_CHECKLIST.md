## 💡 Tips for Answering

### Tip 1: Profit Margin

- If unsure, use Net Margin (Option B)
- Most comprehensive approach
- Current database already calculates it

### Tip 2: Revenue

- Most common: Sum of completed sales last 90 days
- Include both pharmacy and branch levels
- Refunds should reduce revenue

### Tip 3: Costs

- Current implementation uses: COGS + Inventory + Operational
- This is comprehensive and recommended
- Loyalty discounts are separate

### Tip 4: Trends

- Monthly is best for executive dashboard
- Weekly if you need more granularity
- Daily for detailed analysis

### Tip 5: Health Thresholds

- No one-size-fits-all
- Consider your industry standards
- Can be adjusted anytime
