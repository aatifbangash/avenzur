### 2. **Created Cost Centre Views** ✅

- Pharmacy detail view (with branches)

## 🔧 The Error That Was Fixed

**Original Error:**

```
ERROR: Class 'Admin_Controller' not found in Cost_center.php line 16

**Fix Applied:**

```php
// Before (❌)
class Cost_center extends Admin_Controller {

// After (✅)
class Cost_center extends MY_Controller {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        if (!$this->loggedIn) {
            // redirect to login
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```
