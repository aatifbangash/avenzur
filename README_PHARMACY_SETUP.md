## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Hierarchy Structure

```
Pharmacy Group (Company)
    ├── Pharmacy (with warehouse_type = 'pharmacy')
    │   ├── Main Warehouse (warehouse_type = 'mainwarehouse')
    │   └── Sub Warehouses (warehouse_type = 'warehouse')
    │
    └── Branch (warehouse_type = 'branch', parent_id = pharmacy_id)
        └── Warehouse(s)
```

### Database Relationships

```
loyalty_pharmacy_groups
    ↓ (one-to-many)
loyalty_pharmacies
    ↓ (links to)
sma_warehouses (pharmacy)
    ↓ (parent-child)
sma_warehouses (mainwarehouse)

sma_warehouses (pharmacy)
    ↑ (parent)
sma_warehouses (branch)
    ↓ (linked to)
loyalty_branches
```
