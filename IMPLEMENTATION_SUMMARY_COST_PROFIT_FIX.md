**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR EXECUTION  
**Commit:** `4915fd29b`

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ User Clarification Received

**User Input:** "Cost should come from sma_purchases and profit from sma_sales."

This critical requirement was captured and acted upon immediately.

### 2. ✅ Migration File Created

**File:** `app/migrations/cost-center/006_fix_cost_profit_calculations.sql`  
**Size:** ~500 lines of SQL  
**Location:** `app/migrations/cost-center/006_fix_cost_profit_calculations.sql`

**What It Does:**

- Creates `view_sales_monthly` - aggregates sma_sales by warehouse/month
- Creates `view_purchases_monthly` - aggregates sma_purchases by warehouse/month
- Updates `view_cost_center_pharmacy` - uses new sales/purchases sources
- Updates `view_cost_center_branch` - uses new sales/purchases sources
- Updates `view_cost_center_summary` - uses new sales/purchases sources

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation Created

**File:** `COST_PROFIT_CALCULATION_FIX.md`  
**Size:** ~400 lines  
**Content:**

- Executive summary of changes
- Before/after comparison
- Technical details and formulas
- Data relationships and joins
- Verification queries
- Expected impact analysis
- Rollback plan

### 4. ✅ Code Committed

**Commit Message:**

```
feat: Add migration 006 to fix cost calculation - use sma_purchases instead of fact table

CRITICAL CHANGE: Cost and profit calculations updated
- Cost now sourced from sma_purchases (actual purchase amounts)
- Profit calculated as Revenue (sma_sales) - Cost (sma_purchases)
- Affects all financial KPIs (cost, profit, margin)
```

---

## Key Changes Explained

### OLD CALCULATION (Incorrect)

```
Revenue:    From sma_fact_cost_center.total_revenue
Cost:       COGS + Inventory Movement + Operational (fact table)
Profit:     Revenue - Cost
Margin %:   (Profit / Revenue) * 100
```

### NEW CALCULATION (Correct)

```
Revenue:    SUM(sma_sales.grand_total) per warehouse per month
Cost:       SUM(sma_purchases.grand_total) per warehouse per month
Profit:     Revenue - Cost
Margin %:   (Profit / Revenue) * 100
```

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Helper Views

#### view_sales_monthly

Groups sales transactions by:

- Warehouse ID
- Year/Month
- Sums `grand_total` from `sma_sales`

#### view_purchases_monthly

Groups purchase transactions by:

- Warehouse ID
- Year/Month
- Sums `grand_total` from `sma_purchases`

### Updated Primary Views

#### view_cost_center_pharmacy

- **Before:** Used sma_fact_cost_center
- **After:** Joins view_sales_monthly + view_purchases_monthly
- **Fields:** revenue, cost, profit, margin_pct, entity_count

#### view_cost_center_branch

- **Before:** Used sma_fact_cost_center
- **After:** Joins view_sales_monthly + view_purchases_monthly
- **Fields:** revenue, cost, profit, margin_pct, sales_count, purchase_count

#### view_cost_center_summary

- **Before:** Aggregated from sma_fact_cost_center
- **After:** Aggregates from view_sales/view_purchases
- **Fields:** company-level + pharmacy-level summaries

## Data Impact Example

### Pharmacy 52 - October 2025

| Metric  | Old Source         | Old Value   | New Source         | New Value    | Change  |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Revenue | fact_table         | 648,800 SAR | sma_sales          | 648,800 SAR  | —       |
| Cost    | fact_table COGS    | 450,000 SAR | sma_purchases      | ~520,000 SAR | +70,000 |
| Profit  | Revenue - Old Cost | 198,800 SAR | Revenue - New Cost | ~128,800 SAR | -70,000 |
| Margin  | Old Profit/Revenue | 30.6%       | New Profit/Revenue | ~19.8%       | -10.8pp |

**Note:** Exact new values depend on actual data in sma_purchases for October 2025.

## Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Execute Migration ⏳

```bash
# Option A: Via MySQL directly
mysql -u admin -p retaj_aldawa < app/migrations/cost-center/006_fix_cost_profit_calculations.sql

# Option B: Via CodeIgniter CLI (if configured)
php spark migrate
```

### Step 2: Verify Views Created ⏳

```sql
-- Check if views exist
SHOW FULL TABLES IN retaj_aldawa WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'VIEW';

-- Should see:
-- view_sales_monthly
-- view_purchases_monthly
-- view_cost_center_pharmacy
-- view_cost_center_branch
-- view_cost_center_summary
```

### Step 3: Test Dashboard ⏳

1. Open: `http://localhost:8080/avenzur/admin/cost_center/dashboard?period=2025-10`
2. Verify: Revenue and cost numbers updated
3. Test: Pharmacy filter works
4. Check: All 8 pharmacies show data

### Step 4: Verify Calculations ⏳

```sql
-- Compare calculated KPIs
SELECT
    entity_name,
    period,
    kpi_total_revenue AS revenue,
    kpi_total_cost AS cost,
    kpi_profit_loss AS profit,
    kpi_profit_margin_pct AS margin_pct
FROM view_cost_center_summary
WHERE period = '2025-10'
ORDER BY kpi_total_revenue DESC;

-- Should show new cost values from sma_purchases
```

### Step 5: Update Documentation ⏳

- Update release notes with cost calculation change
- Brief team on new methodology
- Update dashboard user guide

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                     | Level  | Mitigation                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data accuracy            | LOW    | Uses actual source tables (sma_sales, sma_purchases)         |
| Query performance        | MEDIUM | Added 2 helper views, should index `warehouse_id` and `date` |
| Financial metrics change | HIGH   | Documented and expected; more accurate than before           |
| User confusion           | MEDIUM | Clear documentation provided; release notes required         |
| Rollback complexity      | LOW    | Can revert to migration 005 if needed                        |

## Success Criteria

✅ = Verified  
⏳ = Pending (next steps)  
❌ = Failed

### Pre-Implementation

- ✅ User confirmed cost source (sma_purchases) and profit source (sma_sales)
- ✅ Migration file created and reviewed
- ✅ Documentation completed and detailed
- ✅ Code committed to git

### Post-Implementation (TODO)

- ⏳ Migration executed successfully
- ⏳ All views created without errors
- ⏳ Dashboard displays new numbers
- ⏳ Pharmacy filter works with new calculations
- ⏳ All 8 pharmacies showing correct revenue and cost
- ⏳ Profit = Revenue - Cost verified
- ⏳ Margin % calculations accurate
- ⏳ API endpoint returns new data
- ⏳ No browser console errors
- ⏳ Dashboard load time < 500ms

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If Views Don't Create

```sql
-- Check for errors in migration
-- Run manually with error reporting:
source app/migrations/cost-center/006_fix_cost_profit_calculations.sql;

-- Check existing views
SHOW CREATE VIEW view_sales_monthly\G

-- If join issues, verify tables exist:
DESCRIBE sma_sales;
DESCRIBE sma_purchases;
DESCRIBE sma_dim_pharmacy;
```

### If Dashboard Still Shows Old Numbers

```sql
-- Verify views are being used by model
-- Check view contains data:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM view_cost_center_summary WHERE period = '2025-10';

-- Check sma_sales has October 2025 data:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sma_sales WHERE YEAR(date) = 2025 AND MONTH(date) = 10;

-- Check sma_purchases has October 2025 data:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sma_purchases WHERE YEAR(date) = 2025 AND MONTH(date) = 10;
```

### If Performance Issues

```sql
-- Add indexes for better performance:
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_warehouse_date ON sma_sales(warehouse_id, YEAR(date), MONTH(date));
CREATE INDEX idx_purchases_warehouse_date ON sma_purchases(warehouse_id, YEAR(date), MONTH(date));
```
