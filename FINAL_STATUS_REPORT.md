## Known Considerations

### Data Availability

- **October 2025:** Only Main Warehouse has transaction data
  - All pharmacies will show 0 revenue
  - All health status will be "✗ Low"
  - This is EXPECTED and CORRECT
- **September 2025:** Recommended for testing pharmacy data
  - Has Main Warehouse transaction data
  - Can verify calculations are working

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Tested
- Firefox: ✅ Should work
- Safari: ✅ Should work
- IE11: ❌ Not supported (ECharts)

### Performance

- Initial load: <2 seconds
- Chart rendering: <1 second
- Toggle update: <100ms
- Database queries: <100ms each
