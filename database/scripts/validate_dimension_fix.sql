-- Data Validation Script: Verify warehouse_id Fix
-- ============================================================
-- File: validate_dimension_fix.sql
-- Purpose: Validate the pharmacy_id vs warehouse_id fix
-- Date: 2025-10-26
--
-- VALIDATION CHECKS:
-- 1. sma_dim_pharmacy has warehouse_id as PRIMARY KEY
-- 2. sma_dim_branch references pharmacy_warehouse_id correctly
-- 3. All dimension records have valid parent relationships
-- 4. Views return correct data with warehouse_id
-- 5. Fact table pharmacy_id values match pharmacy hierarchy
