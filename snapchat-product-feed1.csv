 product is used for the treatment of adults and children with skin 
problems involving a layer of scales covering the affected skin. </li><li>This product will help in decreasing the itchiness and redness of your skin and removing the layer of scales.</li></ul><p>Do not use Betamethasone di-propionate/ salicylic acid:</p><ul><li>If you have an allergy to Betamethasone di-propionate, salicylic acid, or any of the ingredients present in this product.</li><li>If the package is ripped or has signs of tampering.</li><li>If the expiry date mentioned on the medication box has passed.</li><li>If you experience an allergic reaction or skin irritation upon use of this ointment. </li><li>If
