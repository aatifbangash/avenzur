 di-propionate belongs to a class of medicines known as‚Äù topical 
corticosteroids‚Äù that acts by reducing inflammation, itchiness and 
redness of the skin. </li><li>Salicylic acid is a medicine that acts by 
softening the top layer of scales present on the surface of your skin, 
allowing betamethasone di-propionate to reach the affected skin area 
below the scales in order to help with your skin disease recovery. </li><li>This
 product is used for the treatment of adults and children with skin 
problems involving a layer of scales covering the affected skin. </li><li>This product will help in decreasing the itchiness and redness of your skin and removing the layer of scales.</li></ul><p>Do not use Betamethasone di-propionate/ salicylic acid:</p><ul><li>If you have an allergy to Betamethasone di-propionate, salicylic acid, or any of the ingredients present in this product.</li><li>If the package is ripped or has signs of tampering.</li><li>If the expiry date mentioned on the medication box has passed.</li><li>If you experience an allergic reaction or skin irritation upon use of this ointment. </li><li>If
